# The ideal adapter: Life-long, hierarchical distributional learning

The ideal adapter is a computational-level theory of how human speech
perception copes with variability at various levels.  Even for a single talker,
speech is highly variable: linguistic units (phonetic categories, words, etc.)
are _distributions_ of acoustic cues.  This means that speech perception is a
problem of inference under uncertainty.  When the listener knows the
distribution of cues for each category, they can work backwards from a
particular observed cue value to _infer_ how likely each category was.  As
distributional learning theories of language acquisition have long acknowledged,
these distributions must be _learned_ during acquisition.

The ideal adapter, however, further implicates distributional learning in adult
language processing, in two ways.  First, speech is variable not only _within_ a
talker but also _between_ talkers.  Thus, the cue distribution for each phonetic
category (or other linguistic unit) changes from one situation to the next, and
listeners need to continuously update their beliefs about these cue
distributions via distributional learning.  Indeed, listeners rapidly adapt to
unfamiliar talkers, and this adaptation is quantitatively well predicted by a
simple belief updating model based on the principles of distributional learning.

Second, for an ideal adapter distributional learning is _hierarchical_.  A
critical difference between acquisition and adult language processing is that
adults have substantial experience with other talkers.  This experience is
useful to an ideal adapter because it makes some accents (cue distributions)
more likely than others, which provides an informative starting point for
distributional learning.  However, for this experience to be useful, listeners
need to generalize from _particular_ prior experiences.  This, in turn requires
that they learn (implicitly or explicitly) the _distribution_ of talkers'
accents, at multiple levels (e.g., all speakers of English, females, people from
Detroit).  Such hierarchical distributional learning is how an ideal adapter
balances stability and plasticity, and is supported qualitatively by listeners'
ability to recognize (and benefit from) familiar talkers, generalize to similar
talkers, and adapt to novel talkers.

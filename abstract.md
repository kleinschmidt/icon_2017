# The ideal adapter: Life-long, hierarchical distributional learning

The _ideal adapter_ is a computational-level theory of how human speech
perception copes with variability at various levels.  Even for a single talker,
speech is highly variable: linguistic units (phonetic categories, words, etc.)
are _distributions_ of acoustic cues.  This means that speech perception is a
problem of inference under uncertainty.  When the listener knows the
distribution of cues that corresponds to each (phonetic) category, they can work
backwards from a particular observed cue value to _infer_ how likely each
category was.  As distributional learning theories of language acquisition have
long acknowledged, these distributions must be _learned_ during acquisition.

The ideal adapter, however, goes further by placing distributional
learning front and center in adult language processing, in two ways.  First,
speech is variable not only _within_ a talker but also _between_ talkers.  Thus,
the cue distribution for each phonetic category (or other linguistic unit)
changes from one situation to the next, and listeners need to continuously
update their beliefs about these cue distributions via distributional learning.
Indeed, listeners rapidly adapt to unfamiliar talkers, and they do so in way
that is quantitatively well predicted by a simple belief updating model based on
the principles of distributional learning.

The second insight of the ideal adapter is that distributional learning is
_hierarchical_.  A critical difference between acquisition and adult language
processing is that adults have substantial prior experience, with a range of
talkers.  This experience is useful to an ideal adapter because it makes some
accents (sets of cue distributions) more likely than others, which provides an
informative starting point for distributional learning.  However, for this
experience to be useful, a listener needs to be able to generalize from
particular prior experiences.  This, in turn requires that listeners learn
(implicitly or explicitly) the _distribution_ of talkers' accents (sets of cue
distributions), at multiple levels (e.g., all speakers of English, females,
people from Detroit, etc.).  Such hierarchical distributional learning is how an
ideal adapter balances stability and plasticity, and is supported qualitatively
by listeners' ability to recognize (and benefit from) familiar talkers,
generalize to similar talkers, and adapt to novel talkers.
